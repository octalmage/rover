## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) along with a
recent `rustc` and `cargo` version installed. Currently, we are testing on 1.51.0+.

And you need to have the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target installed as well.

You can check that via:

```sh
rustc --version
cargo --version
rustup target list --installed
# if wasm32 is not listed above, run this
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

## Compiling and running tests

Now that you created your custom contract, make sure you can compile and run it before
making any changes. Go into the repository and do:

```sh
# this will produce a wasm build in ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/YOUR_NAME_HERE.wasm
cargo wasm

# this runs unit tests with helpful backtraces
RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo unit-test

# auto-generate json schema
cargo schema
```
